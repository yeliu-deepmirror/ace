# Summary of 2023 work on ACE

current problem :
* change of camera parameters can make the model fail to work.
  * todo: train and query with same image intrinsics (use undistortion algorithm)
* the post-process : PNP-RANSAC is too slow, can consume too much memory.
  * add an indicate as output from network to reduce ransac candidate size.
  * update PNP algorithm.
